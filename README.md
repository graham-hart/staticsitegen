# Static Site Generator

```
Example Directory Structure:
content/
    - about
    - blogs/
        - b1
        - b2

generated/
    - about.html
    - index.html
    - blogs/
        - blogs.html
        - b1.html
        - b2.html
```

The navbar will include all links inside the `content/` directory unless otherwise specified (Method TBD)

An index.html page will be automatically generated, you can customize what pages are previewed (Method TBD)

For the record, I have no clue what I'm doing. If my code is shit, I'm sorry.
